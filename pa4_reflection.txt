1. (1pt) Approximately how long did you spend on this PA?
27 hours due to being lost in how to use the functionality on the Trees on an external file. The worksheet was also a tad jarring\
for computer science course but I found it very similar to class work. The Java transition still gets the better of me at times.
2. (4pt) What did you find similar about the implementation of the BSTree/BSTNode and the Node/DoublyLinkedList from PA 1? What was different?
The similarity is the nested structures with Node being nearly the same but different.\
Also using the "generic" (in our case we're doing so with strings) data types in their implementations. \
Direct reference should be made to values that should follow a condition as opposed to the LinkedList "first come" implementation.\


3. (3pt) Try searching for your favorite actor (or just any actor you know) in the dataset. What movies, studios, and ratings appear? Is this what you expect? Why or why not? (Don't forget to let us know who you searched for!)
I looked up Ben Affleck I thought it pretty cool how he divorced J-Lo recently because\
of the crime she was involved in. I saw in this film he's only got batman-superman with PG13.\
Which sounds right since it's a superhero movie so no surprises.
4. (2pt) Do you think a tree is an appropriate data structure to use for a search engine/database? Why or why not? (Thereâ€™s no right or wrong answers here!)
Avoiding the O(N) at all costs is a must for scope how large datasets can grow to.\
Being able to make realizations on the data without having to have all data has \
massive bearing in data science where the whole goal is lowering the number of\
dimensions in play.
